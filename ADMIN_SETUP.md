# Admin Analytics Dashboard Setup

This guide will help you set up and use the comprehensive admin analytics dashboard for your Somema AI application.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Navigate to `/admin` in your application. You'll need admin privileges to access this area.

3. Update the `business_name` field to include "admin" or "somema"
