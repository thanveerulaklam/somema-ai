## 📊 Payment Flow Architecture

```
User selects plan
    ↓
Payment Method Selection
    ├── UPI AutoPay (Default) → Create mandate → User authorizes → Subscription active
    ├── Credit Card → Razorpay checkout → Payment success → Subscription active
    └── One-time → Razorpay checkout → Payment success → Plan active
    ↓
Webhook Processing
    ├── subscription.authenticated → Activate subscription + allocate credits
    ├── subscription.charged → Renew subscription + refresh credits
    └── payment.captured → Activate one-time plan + allocate credits
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### UPI AutoPay Limitations:
- **Transaction limit**: ₹15,000 per transaction

### Credit Card Considerations:
- **International users**: Primary option for non-Indian users

- **Card expiration**: Requires user updates

### One-time Payments:
- **Fallback option**: For users who can't use subscriptions
- **Manual renewal**: Users need to remember to renew
- **Higher churn**: No automatic renewal

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Payment method adoption rates**
- **Conversion rates by payment method**
- **Payment failure rates**
- **Subscription churn rates**
- **Revenue per user by payment method**

### Logging:
- All payment events are logged with detailed information
- Webhook events are tracked for debugging
- Credit allocation is logged for audit purposes

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **UPI AutoPay mandate not created**: Check Razorpay configuration
2. **Credits not allocated**: Check webhook handling and database updates
3. **Payment method not working**: Verify API endpoints and error handling
4. **Webhook not receiving events**: Check webhook URL and event configuration

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for client-side errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify Razorpay dashboard for payment status
4. Check database for proper record creation
5. Test webhook endpoints manually
